# Autism Detector using IBM Watson Studio

## Overview

The Autism Detector is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of autism in an individual based on certain screening test results. This application uses IBM Watson Studio for model deployment and offers an intuitive interface for users to take the autism screening test and get predictions about autism based on their answers.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and clean design, making it easy for users to navigate through the screening test and get results.
- **AI-Powered Prediction**: The backend uses a machine learning model deployed via IBM Watson Studio that predicts whether an individual is at risk for autism based on user input.
- **Real-Time Results**: The app provides instant results after submitting the screening responses, with recommendations for further assistance based on the result.
- **Guidance for Autistic Individuals**: The app not only provides the result but also suggests help and resources for individuals who may be at risk of autism.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript (for form handling and prediction submission)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Python (Flask for the web framework)
  - IBM Watson Studio (for model training, deployment, and prediction)
  
- **Deployment**:
  - GitHub (for source code management)
  
## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user provides answers to a series of screening questions based on specific traits observed in individuals with autism.
2. **Prediction**: Once the user completes the form, the application sends the data to an AI model hosted on IBM Watson Studio for prediction.
3. **Result**: The AI model provides a prediction result indicating whether the individual might have autism or not.
4. **Recommendations**: Based on the result, the app provides guidance, resources, and recommendations to assist the user in further steps.
